# DSA210-Project


## Introduction:

*"I only got **X** hours of sleep"*, a statement you will hear often within your time as an undergraduate student. Most of us have developed a biasy towards the duration of our sleep to the extent that some become dependent upon it and claim that they cannot function with anything less.

But how correct is this way of thinking? Many of the leading figures in the field of sleep analysis have emphesized that although sleep duration is still significant, what matters is the **_sleep quality_**, 8 hours only being a deduced average duration, one that highly varies, not only from person to person but also lifestyle to lifestyle.


## Project overview:

The goal with this project is to collect data on my sleep as well as log "sleep improving/inhibiting" habits and analyze their impact on my sleep quality metrics such as: light sleep, deep sleep, REM sleep etc, with the ultimate goal being to maximize the benefits of sleep.

Here is a diagram illustrating the tracked data structure:

## Data collection:

### Habits

These habits will be tracked every day and their effect on sleep quality will be analyzed.

1. **Morning sunlight:**  
   marked as 1 for above 5 minutes of sunlight before 9 AM and 0 otherwise.
   
2. **Sugar cosumption:**  
   marked as 1 if above 20 grams of sugar were consumed.

4. **Exercise:**  
   marked as 1 if a workout like weight lifting/jogging took place.

5. **Social Media before sleep**  
   marked as 1 if social media is used 30 minutes before bed.

6. **Caffeine consumption**  
   marked as 1 if I drank tea/coffee past 6pm.

7. **Food before bed**  
   marked as 1 if anything was eaten less than an hour before bed.

8. **Nap**  
   marked as 1 if a nap was taken midday.
   



### Sleep Metrics:
The Apple Watch Ultra 2, known for having one of the best sleep tracking from the fitness gadgets available on the market, will be used.
We will track the total amount as well as percentages of :

1. **DEEP SLEEP.**
2. **REM SLEEP.**
3. **LIGHT/CORE sleep.**

We will collect, export and analyze this data to see the imapact the tracked habits have on my sleep quality.
