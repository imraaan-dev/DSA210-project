# DSA210-Project


## Introduction:

*"I only got **X** hours of sleep"*, a statement you will hear often within your time as an undergraduate student. Most of us have developed a biasy towards the duration of our sleep to the extent that some become dependent upon it and claim that they cannot function with anything less.

But how correct is this way of thinking? Many of the leading figures in the field of sleep analysis have emphesized that although sleep duration is still significant, what matters is the **_sleep quality_**, 8 hours only being a deduced average duration, one that highly varies, not only from person to person but also lifestyle to lifestyle.


## Project overview:

The goal with this project is to track my "sleep improving/inhibiting" habits and analyze their impact on my sleep quality metrics such as: light sleep, deep sleep, REM sleep, etc. Then various performance metrics will be measured to analyze the effect that sleep has had on them, with the ultimate goal being to maximize the benefits of sleep.

Here is a diagram illustrating the tracked data structure:

## Data collection:

### Habits

These habits will be tracked every day and their effect on sleep quality will be analyzed.

1. **Morning sunlight:**  
   marked as 1 for above 5 minutes of sunlight before 9 AM and 0 otherwise.
   
2. **Sugar cosumption:**  
   the total grams of sugar eaten per day will be tracked, manually.

3. **Food quantity:**  
   The number of meals each day will be tracked as well as a self-rated fullness level for each meal, measured in thirds (1/3 or 2/3 3/3)

4. **Exercise:**  
   marked as 1 if a workout like weight lifting/jogging took place.

5. **Social Media before sleep**  
   marked as 1 if social media is used 30 minutes before bed.

6. **Caffeine consumption**  
   marked as 1 if I drank tea/coffee past 6pm.

7. **Food before bed**  
   marked as 1 if anything was eaten less than an hour before bed.

8. **Level of light before bed**  
   a self-rated measure from 1-10 of the brightness in the environment 1 hour before bed.
   




_more habits may be added later on_



### Sleep Metrics:
The Apple Watch Ultra 2, known for having one of the best sleep tracking from the fitness gadgets available on the market, will be used and worn every night from the project start date. 

We will track the total amount as well as percentages of :

1. **DEEP SLEEP.**
2. **REM SLEEP.**
3. **LIGHT/CORE sleep.**

We will collect and export this data and see how it impacts our performance metrics.




### Performance metrics:

These are the metrics I will use to track how productive/performent I was in the day.

1. **Average time to complete a university task**  
   This is a system that I developed in an attempt to standarnize and make tracking productivity objective. The way the metric works is that I will track each university related task such as doing an assignment, revising a topic etc. For each task I will track the number of hours it took to complete it. Then an average of time per assignment will be calculated for each day. What will count as a task will have objective guidelines like being an assignment, or a chapter in the book etc.
   
2. **Fatigue:**  
   A self-rated metric in which I will give a score from 1-10 for how tired I felt during that day.

3. **Focus and Energy:**  
   A self-rated metric in which I will give a score from 1-10 for how focused and energized I felt during that day.




This is it for now, more details to be added after proposal review.
